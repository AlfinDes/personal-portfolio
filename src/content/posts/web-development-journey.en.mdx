Learning web development taught me that building a website is not just about appearance, but also about how logic and data flow work behind the scenes. My journey started with HTML and CSS, then evolved to JavaScript and backend fundamentals using Express.js.

In this article, I share the experiences and understanding I gained during this learning process.

## Website Foundation with HTML and CSS

HTML and CSS became the main foundation in every project I worked on. I learned how to structure pages neatly using semantic HTML and arrange displays to be consistent and responsive using CSS.

Some things I focused on:

- Clear and easy-to-understand layout structure
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Organized and maintainable CSS writing

This approach helped me build clean and professional website displays.

## Making Websites More Alive with JavaScript

After understanding the display, I started adding interactivity using JavaScript. At this stage, I learned how websites can respond to user actions in real-time.

Implementation examples I learned:

- DOM manipulation to change content dynamically
- Event handling such as clicks and submits
- Simple form validation
- Basic logic to improve user experience

JavaScript made the websites I built feel more alive and functional.

## Getting to Know Backend through Express.js Fundamentals

To understand how the frontend connects to the server, I started learning Express.js fundamentals. At this stage, I learned:

- Creating a simple server with Node.js
- Basic routing using Express
- How to handle requests and responses
- Simple REST API concepts

Although still at the fundamental stage, Express.js helped me understand the big picture of web application workflow comprehensively.

## Conclusion

Learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Express.js is a gradual process that complements each other. Each technology has an important role in building a complete web application.

Through this article, I want to document my learning journey while showing my commitment to continue growing as a web developer.
